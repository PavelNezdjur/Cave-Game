This is a cave drone game where the player controls a drone navigating through a procedurally generated cave. 
The challenge is to avoid collisions with the cave walls while scoring points based on how far the drone travels and its speed. 
The game is built using React for the frontend, Zustand for state management, and it connects to a server via WebSocket for real-time updates. 
Additionally, Axios is used for HTTP requests, and the game's physics and collision detection are handled with custom JavaScript utilities.
